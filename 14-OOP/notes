4 fundamental principles
ABSTRACTION
    Ignore or hide details that don't matter.  Gives an overview
ENCAPSULATION
    Keep methods private inside the class.  Some methods can be exposed as a public interface (API)
INHERITANCE
    Makes properties and methods available to a child class.  Reuse common logic.
POLYMORPHISM 
    A child class can overwrite a method inherited from a parent class.
